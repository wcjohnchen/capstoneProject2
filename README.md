# Machine Learning Modeling and Prediction of Housing Prices

## Proposal:

The goal of this study is to accurately predict housing prices by comparing various machine learning models: linear, ridge, lasso, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based regression and classification.  This dataset includes relevant features and images of houses in Southern California (https://www.kaggle.com/ted8080/house-prices-and-images-socal).
