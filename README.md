# Capstone Project 2

## Proposal I:

Dataset: Housing Price in Beijing:

https://www.kaggle.com/ted8080/house-prices-and-images-socal

This dataset includes the housing prices and their features at Beijing, China.  The goal of this study is to accurately predict the prices by comparing various models: linear, ridge, lasso, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and convolutional neural network-based regression.

## Proposal II:
Dataset: House Prices and Images - SoCal:

https://www.kaggle.com/ted8080/house-prices-and-images-socal

This dataset includes the housing prices and their images in Southern Califronia.  The goal of this study to predict the prices from images using convolutional neural network.

## Proposal III:

Dataset: Mice Protein Expression:

https://www.kaggle.com/ruslankl/mice-protein-expression/

This dataset contains protein expression levels measured in Down syndrome and control mice, and is related to associate learning and drug assessment.  The goal of this study is to build an effective model to accurately classify mice exposed to different conditions.
